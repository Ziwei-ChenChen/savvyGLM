Description: This package provides an advanced framework for fitting Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)
    using custom slab and shrinkage estimators. The implemented methods include the Stein estimator (St), 
    Diagonal Shrinkage (DSh), Shrinkage Ridge (SR), Generalized Slab Regression (GSR), and Shrinkage (Sh).
    These estimators are integrated into the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm 
    to enhance estimation accuracy, convergence properties, and robustness, particularly in the presence 
    of multicollinearity. The optimal model is chosen based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), 
    ensuring reliable inference across a broad range of applications.
