Description: This package provides functions for fitting Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) using advanced slab and shrinkage
    estimators such as Stein (St), Diagonal Shrinkage (DSh), Shrinkage Ridge (SR), Generalized Slab Regression (GSR),
    and Shrinkage (Sh). These methods improve the convergence and stability of the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS)
    algorithm, addressing issues like multicollinearity and optimizing coefficient estimates. The best fitting model is
    selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), ensuring robust and accurate results across a wide range of scenarios.
