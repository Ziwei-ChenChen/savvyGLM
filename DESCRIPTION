Description: Provides a flexible framework for fitting generalized linear models (GLMs) 
    with slab and shrinkage estimators. Methods include the Stein estimator (St), 
    Diagonal Shrinkage (DSh), Shrinkage Ridge (SR), Generalized Slab Regression (GSR), 
    and Shrinkage (Sh), all integrated into the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) 
    algorithm. This approach enhances estimation accuracy, convergence, and robustness 
    in the presence of multicollinearity. The best-fitting model is selected based on 
    the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
